            <h2>Persona</h2>
            <h3>Yuki Yamada</h3>
            <p>Yuki has started a welfare service.
                He employs about 20 employees and is worried about their evaluation system.
                In addition, he is now 30 years old and still has little knowledge of management and wants to deepen his relationship with other managers.
                He is married and has a five-year-old daughter.My hobby is snowboarding.
                Recently, however, his business has been busy and he has not had time for hobbies.

            <h2>Scenarios</h2>
            <h3>Scenario 1</h3>
            <p>He came to our company to ask for improvements in the evaluation system.
                He currently does not have clear standards for employee evaluation systems.
                We will propose him a proposal for an evaluation sheet, a specific employee analysis, and a quarterly evaluation.
            </p>

            <h3>Scenario 2</h3>
            <p> He will probably visit our company in search of interaction with other management.
                We encourage him to attend a free management seminar run by our company.
                He then meets other managers at the seminar.
                We will help deepen our exchanges on the spot.Ultimately, the partnership will be completed.
            </p>
